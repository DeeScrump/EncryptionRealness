Create a password generator based on inputs from the user

## Expectations
1. User will land on a page requiring them to generate a password
2. User should be able to decide whether how long in characters the password wil be, as well as whether the password will include capital letters, lowercase letters and/or special characters.
3. User will be restricted in their responses on all questions
4. User will be displayed a resulting random password that matches their requirements.
5. User will receive prompts after each response confirming the receipt of their positive or negative input.
